# 📝 Blog App

## 📌 Project Description

A **Full-Stack Blog Web Application** built using **Django**, **Django REST Framework**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

All posts are stored in a database with fields like `title`, `content`, `author`, and `timestamps`.

This project demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and deploy a complete full-stack web application.
