Blog App
Project Description
Developed a full-stack Blog App using Django, Django REST Framework, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts with a user-friendly interface. The app features user authentication, search functionality, and a RESTful API for seamless data interaction. Posts are stored in a database with fields for title, content, author, and timestamps, and the frontend is styled for a clean and responsive user experience. The project is hosted on GitHub, showcasing my ability to build and deploy a complete web application.
